  <p>The book American Prometheus The Triumph and Tragedy of J.Robert Oppenheimer is a biography about the inventor of the Atomic Bomb J Robert Oppenheimer.  It starts with talking about his early life and his rise in the Scientific community and his work in the field in quantum physics. Then it talks about his years working on the Manhattan project with the United States government during world war 2. Near the end of the book it talks about his conflicts with government officials and accusations of past political ties as well as the political hearing that took away his status and influence in science and the US government.</p>

  <h3>Early life</h3>
 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Harvard_University_coat_of_arms.svg"alt="Harvard" class="college">
  <p>Oppenheimer’s early life was a bit different than most kids his age. He was born to Julius and Ella Oppenheimer in 1904 and also had a little brother named Frank Oppenheimer. During his school days his advanced intellect was shown greatly. "He was extraordinarily brilliant, yet so solitary that even his closest friends could hardly understand the depth of his thought" (Bird and Sherwin 28).However he dealt with great emotional struggle along with insecurity and loneliness. He went to the Ethical Culture society school for high school where his dad was on the board of trustees. He had a deep interest in English and French literature and had a deep interest in mineralogy during his years there. After high school he got accepted into Harvard University. However he could not attend for one year due to the fact that he contracted Colitis while on vacation in Czechoslovakia. During this time he spent recovering in New Mexico he developed a love of horseback riding and developed a deep interest in the area of the southwestern United States. At Harvard he chose to major in the field of Chemistry. He graduated Harvard as Summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts after only three years.</p>

  <p>After Harvard, He was given a lab position with professor JJ Thompson after getting Rejected by Ernest Rutherford but he had to take a basic lab course before working in the lab. However Oppenheimer did not have a good time at Cambridge and often felt like the lab work was boring there. He also dealt with many Mental Health issues there as well. In 1926 he left Cambridge to go to the University of Gottingen to study under Max Born. Gottingen was a leading university for theoretical physics at the time. While there he met Werner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac and many other great physicists. He was so enthusiastic about physics that the professors had to put a note on their desk saying he had to be quiet or calm down."Oppenheimer’s enthusiasm for theoretical physics was so intense that it unsettled even the most accomplished professors" (Bird and Sherwin 102). He obtained his Doctorate in Philosophy under Born. While in Europe he published many papers and added to the new field of Quantum Mechanics. He created the Born Oppenheimer Approximation. “The Born-Oppenheimer approximation allowed scientists to separate the movement of electrons from the movement of nuclei in molecules, making complex calculations much simpler"(Bird and Sherwin 112).</p>

  <h2>Research in the U.S.</h2>
  <p>He then went to teach at UC Berkeley and did research in Theoretical Astronomy and Nuclear physics along with Quantum Mechanics. He also published a few papers on Quantum Tunneling. He also created a series of Papers in Astrophysics with his friend Richard Tolman.He also did research in quantum tunneling."His papers on quantum tunneling opened a window to a strange, probabilistic world that few could comprehend" (Bird and Sherwin 145).</p>

  <p>the United States recruited him to lead the Manhattan project. This was the Project meant to design the first Atomic Bomb. Oppenheimer and Leslie Groves chose to make Los Alamos the base as it was well hidden and in the Middle of New Mexico. In 1943 they developed the Thin Man which was a Plutonium gun type Fission weapon.  However the Reactor bred plutonium had a higher concentration of Plutonium 240 which made it unstable. To fix this they created the little boy which was more of an implosion type weapon. This would be more efficient to use as well. They did the Trinity Test on July 16th 1945 and Oppenheimer then famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita “I am become death the Destroyer of worlds”(Bird and Sherwin 318). On August 6th The United States dropped the First Bomb on Hiroshima and then a few days later they dropped another one on Nagasaki. After the War ended Oppenheimer was named the “Father of the Atomic Bomb”. He was still awarded a Medal for Merit by President Truman. </p>

  <h3>Post war life</h3>
  <p>He was then made Director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton University. He brought many intellectuals together during this time as well to answer many pressing questions. However his political ties were called into question due to possible connections with the communist party. Many political enemies included Lewis Strauss, the man who made him the director of the Institute of Advanced Study. The FBI spied on him for years post war. He was then subjected to a security clearance hearing and after the hearing he lost his clearance."The hearings stripped him of his power, and he emerged a man humbled and exiled from the very government he had served" (Bird and Sherwin 556). After this his final years were lived in peace and exile away from public eye and on February 18th 1967 he died in his home in Princeton New Jersey at the age of 62. His legacy was one of a man who changed history but was taken down by the very government he served.</p>

  <h2>Themes</h2>
  <p>A key theme in the Book was the Morality of War and Science. This was shown as even though Oppenheimer building the Bomb and his leadership at Los Alamos was his great victory it still haunted him for the rest of his life and his guilt and trying to prevent it from happening again.
